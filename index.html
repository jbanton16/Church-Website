						Our fellowship is of - from God, not with no council of men and man-made dogmas. We are-we are people of God who expect fellowship from God. That's where our rights is, is with God. How can we fellowship with God 'less we fellowship in His Word? Because the Word is God. And the Word's made flesh when it becomes you.

							<h1>Our Focus</h1>

							<p>
								We believe that we are now living in the last days, where the promised coming of the Lord is at hand, just waiting for the completion of His church, the fulness of the Gentiles (Romans 11:25).
							</p> <br>

							<p>
								And God opened the mystery of the Bible by the Message of the Hour that called His Bride and gave them Rapturing faith. 
							</p><br>

							<p>
								As part of His Bride, we seek, not just to gather in His Word but to live it by His grace, giving Him honor and praise, getting ready for His coming.

							<h1>The Message</h1>

							<p>
								Not for one moment do i bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those thingsm but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relatioship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart.
